1833612,20521452,MVC5 Store and manager classes,"I know the MVC pattern which stands for Model View Controller.
But Where do Store and Manager class files come from?
I started My project with MongoDB and i implemented the MongoDB.AspNet.Identity.
Which is an extension of the Microsoft.AspNet.Indentity with the EF.
But when looking at the AccountController that is provided by this package they are using the following code.

Now my questions: 

What is the prupose of the Manager class
What is the purpose of the Store class?
And why is the UserManager passed to the Controller of MVC?
And to what pattern belong the Manager and Store classes?

",20522864,5,"This is how I see it:

The Manager class is a concrete instance used to manage users and apply domain logic.
Typically finding users, add passwords and claim management.
The store is what the user manager uses for CRUD implementation.
The UserManager is passed to the constructor so that it can be instantiated and used within the AccountController. You can create another constructor taking it as an arguement for IOC.
I think of the Manager as being like a service layer or fat controller (i.e. contains business logic for managing Users) and the Store as being a repository that deals with CRUD.

I'd like to bind directly properties of my ViewModel which is Server side to the View which is Client Side.
Is there a way for me to do this like if the view was in a normal local MVVM framework?

3052523,20532532,Strategy pattern method that takes other interface,"I am looking to utilize the strategy pattern for a .net application.  I am simplifying the code, but the idea is the same.  There is a transport interface, which will have 2 concrete classes, Car & Motorcycle, both with the only requirement being to implement the driveable method.  To implement it, I want to use the strategy pattern and the IDriveableStrategy interface, which will take a class that implements ITransport and use information in that class to determine if the ITransport is driveable.  I saw some posts questioning the practice of sending the context to the strategy, but I want to ignore that debate for now.  If I implement a class called MotorcycleDriveableStrategy,  I want to use that as a strategy for the Motorcycle class.  
In the code below, you'll notice that I have two additional properties specific to the Motorcycle class, that I would like to use to evaluate whether or not the ITransport is driveable.  In the MotorcycleDriveableStrategy I have commented out how I'd ideally like to implement the class, (have isDriveable implement the interface by taking a Motorcycle, because Motorcycle does implement ITransport) but I get a compilation error when I try that, so I have to keep the method expecting the ITransport interface.
I could achieve the coupling that I wanted by making the IDriveableStrategy interface take a generic that implements ITransport

and declare

but I want to know if I'm missing the bigger picture.  How would this be achieved before generics?  Should the strategy pattern always evaluate the context based off of the exposed interface implementations?  Should the strategy interface not take an interface as a parameter?  Is there another way to achieve this without adding numWheels to the ITransport interface or making the IDriveableStrategy generic?  Thank you in advance for any advice or insight.

The individual strategy should have intimate knowledge of the context.
Please let me know if I completely missed ur point, also I'd be very interested if someone has a differing opinion btw.

Java uses pass by value. Objects and Arrays are actually pointers, so even though it looks like pass by reference, actually the reference is passed as value. This means you can modify the object, but not the reference to it.
 is not used that much, because it merely states that the pointer cannot be modified, but the object it points to can. Thus there is not much use to declare arguments to methods as  in a public interface. It is a nice safeguard in the actual implementation, though. In short:  and Java has no equivalent of .
Even though you can technically only return one object, nothing stops you from returning a container that wraps several new objects into one.
If you just want to (internally) document which objects are modified you can use annotations to mark parameters as e.g.  or . These are not part of the standard or any library I know, though there might very well exist one. Even if not, you can still define your own annotations.

",20546423,0,"He's partially correct. Given a good DI container it is possible to register all your components and resolve the root object in your object tree... the DI container handles creating all the dependency for the root object (recursively) and creates the whole object tree for you. Then you can throw the DI container away. The nice thing about doing it that way is all references to DI container are confined to the entry-point of your app.
However, you are at least one step ahead of the curve since you didn't resolve dependencies in the constructor (or somewhere else) of the object using them, but instead resolved those in the factory and passed them in to the objects that need them via constructor-injection ;) (That's something I see often in code I work on and that is definitely an anti-pattern.

945456,13731918,Building Generic Apps - Allowing Customer-specific Options,"I've built an open source application, and I'd be curious to know how others are handling customer-specific requests. It's important to me to keep the app simple; I'm not trying to make it all things for all people. Apps can get bloated, complex, and just about unusable that way. However, there are some customer-specific options that would be nice (it just wouldn't apply to all customers). For example...
Say we have a domain entity called Server. In the UI, we let a customer pick from a list of servers. For one company, it's helpful to filter the servers by location (US, Germany, France, etc...). It would be easy enough to add a server property like this:

My concern is that Server could become bloated with properties over time. And even if I only add location, not all customers would care about that property.
One option is to allow for user-defined fields:

Is that the best way to handle this? I don't like the fact that type safety is gone by making everything a string. Are there other/better ways that people are handling issues like this? Is there even a design pattern for something like this?

Therefore the database must be queried up to ten million times to get the same connection string ten million times.

I realise it would be better to put the connection string in the config file but I am hoping to be consistent.

Store Config in the Environment
The twelve-factor app stores config in environment variables (often shortened to env vars or env). Env vars are easy to change between deploys without changing any code; unlike config files, there is little chance of them being checked into the code repo accidentally; and unlike custom config files, or other config mechanisms...

The document is targeted more towards apps, but I think a similar approach would work nice here. You can make the call to the database to get the connection string once, and then store it in your process or app domain environment. This will also give you fairly good flexibility when it comes to testing as well.
